You simply have to put this plugin into your plugin folder of Bukkit/Spigot.

**API**

If the counter was reached, the ``AntiRightClickEvent`` will be called. For default, an autokick is enabled - you are able to deactivate this in the config.yml

Example to use:
```Java
package your.package;

import ch.pineirohosting.arc.events.AntiRightClickEvent;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.ChatColor;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;

public class AntiRightClickListener implements Listener {

    @EventHandler
    public void onDetection(final AntiRightClickEvent event) {
        event.getPlayer().kickPlayer("Â§cYou have been kicked for using the Rightclick-Bug, counter:"
            + event.getCounter());
    }

}

```
